# PopGame

A 2D game dev library initially developed for the book HTML5 Game Dev: Novice to Ninja.

## Run example

Runs in modern browsers using native modules (just double-click `index-native.html`). You'll need to serve the example using any webserver for chrome. If you have an olden days browser you can do the npm build dance:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This downloads the internet then runs a web server and serves the example in `test.js`. Browse on http://localhost:9966.

## The library

Docs to come.
